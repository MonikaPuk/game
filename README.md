ðŸŽ® Web Browser game inspired by Game of Thrones ðŸŽ®

Project created during studies "Multimedia Design and Communication" at KEA.

In cooperation with company "Danske Spil" we created a game to attract new customers.

Using the meme which went viral we decided to use it as marketing tool to bring more visits to the page.

We have decided to use "Soft Signupâ€œ. The user can already see a clear value proposition after playing a game, which encourages
him to leave his e-mail in order to exchange the points earned in the game for the real money at Spillhjornet website.
